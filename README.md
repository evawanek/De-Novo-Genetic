# De-Novo-Genetic

## This de novo drug molecule generation process incorporates a genetic algorithm (GA) to explore and optimize molecular structures. Genetic algorithms are inspired by the principles of natural selection and evolution and are particularly well-suited for generating diverse and high-quality molecules. Here's how the GA-based approach works:

### 1. Initialization
Population: We start with an initial population of molecular structures. These structures can be randomly generated or selected from a known chemical database.
### 2. Evaluation
Scoring Function: Each molecule in the population is evaluated using a scoring function. This function considers drug-likeness criteria, such as molecular weight, lipophilicity, hydrogen bond donors, hydrogen bond acceptors, and other relevant properties.
Fitness: The scoring function assigns a fitness score to each molecule, indicating how well it adheres to drug-like properties. Higher scores represent more drug-like candidates.
### 3. Selection
Natural Selection: Molecules are selected for the next generation based on their fitness scores. Selection is biased towards molecules with higher fitness, simulating the survival of the fittest.
### 4. Crossover (Recombination)
Recombination: Pairs of molecules (parents) are randomly chosen from the selected population. Crossover operations (e.g., one-point or two-point crossover) are performed to create new molecules (offspring) by combining fragments from the parents.
### 5. Mutation
Mutation: Some offspring molecules undergo random mutations, introducing small, random changes in their structures. Mutation helps maintain diversity in the population and explore novel chemical space.
### 6. Replacement
Replacement: The offspring, which result from crossover and mutation, replace a portion of the previous generation. This ensures that the population size remains constant.
### 7. Termination
Termination Criteria: The GA continues to iterate through selection, crossover, mutation, and replacement steps for a specified number of generations or until a convergence criterion is met.
### 8. Output
Generated Candidates: The final population after the GA process contains generated molecules that have been optimized for drug-likeness criteria.
The genetic algorithm-based approach facilitates the generation of novel drug-like molecules by iteratively evolving the population, enhancing the chances of discovering promising drug candidates.
